# Searching for Prdm9 homologs in metazoa

I used RefSeq (update Sept. 2021) to search for homologs of Prdm9 within metazoans (see /Users/duret/Travail/Analyses/PRDM9_phylogeny/Prdm9_metazoa/PhylogeneticDistribution_PRDM9_metazoa_2021/README.Prdm9_phylogenetic_profile). 

=> I selected 52 representative full-length sequences covering diverse metazoan clades : PRDM9_metazoa_ReferenceAlignment.mase

NB: in the two hemiptera species (Halyomorpha halys, Nilaparvata lugens) Prdm9 is fast evolving. In Halyomorpha halys, Y276 was mutated into F : loss of methyl-transferase activity -> loss of original Prdm9 function?
 
I annotated the positions of domains:
	KRAB (positions 23..86 in the human Prdm9)
 	SSXRD (positions 171..204 in the human Prdm9)
 	SET  (positions 244..358 in the human Prdm9)
 	N-term ZF (C2H2 ZF encoded at the beginning of the last exon, not within the array; degenerate in some species): 388..411
 	ZF-array (C2H2 ZF in tandem repeats): starting at position 527 in human Prdm9
 
 
To provide insights on the underlying gene structure (exon/intron), I added the protein segments encoded by each human exon (NB: the numbering starts at exon2, because human exon1 is entirely non-coding: 5'UTR).
 	KRAB is encoded by human exons 3 and 4
 	SSXRD is encoded by human exon 7
 	SET is encoded by human exons 8, 9 and 10
 	ZD is encoded by human exon 11
 	
 For the ZF domain (N-term ZF + ZF-array): I computed the multiple alignment anchored on the N-term ZF and on the 1st ZF of the array. The following ZFs of the array are
